Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve a computational puzzle to add a block to the blockchain. The puzzle requires producing a hash below a target value, which is difficult to achieve but easy to verify. If two miners find a solution simultaneously, the network temporarily has two chains, and the longer chain eventually becomes the accepted chain. PoW is secure because attacking it would require more than 50% of the network’s computing power, which is extremely expensive. Bitcoin uses PoW, and Ethereum used it before transitioning to Proof of Stake (PoS). PoW is secure and well-tested but consumes large amounts of energy and requires specialized hardware.

Proof of Stake (PoS) selects validators to propose and confirm blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake and randomness. Validators are penalized through slashing if they act maliciously. PoS is more energy-efficient than PoW and can provide faster finality. Ethereum currently uses PoS, Cardano uses a delegated PoS model with stake pools, and Solana combines PoS with proof-of-history for high throughput. PoS security depends on the economic cost of staking and slashing, and centralization is possible if large holders control most of the stake.

Comparing PoW and PoS shows that PoW relies on computational security and energy consumption, while PoS relies on economic security and staked funds. PoS generally has lower energy use, faster block times, and easier scalability. Entry barriers for PoW include hardware and electricity costs, while PoS requires holding sufficient cryptocurrency to stake. PoW has a long track record with Bitcoin and other chains, and PoS adoption is growing with Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana.

Gas measures computation for transactions on blockchains like Ethereum. Gas cost is calculated as gas used multiplied by gas price (in Gwei). More complex transactions require more gas. Gas price varies with network demand. Gas optimization can be achieved by using Layer 2 solutions, batching transactions, or sending during low network activity.

Blocks contain transaction data, a block header with timestamp, previous block hash, Merkle root, and other information. Block time differs between blockchains and affects transaction finality. Confirmations are the number of blocks added after a block containing a transaction. More confirmations increase security by making chain reorganization unlikely.

Wallets can be custodial, where a third party holds private keys, or non-custodial, where users retain control. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are offline hardware devices. Seed phrases must be stored securely. Security best practices include not sharing seed phrases, using hardware wallets for large balances, and verifying transactions before approval.

Testnets are practice networks where users can test transactions without real cryptocurrency. Sepolia (Ethereum) and Mumbai (Polygon) are examples. Blockchain explorers, such as Etherscan, Polygonscan, and Solscan, display transaction details, contract information, token approvals, and gas tracking.

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to extra profit that validators or miners can earn by reordering, including, or excluding transactions. Examples include front-running and sandwich attacks. Solutions include private transaction pools, commit-reveal schemes, and Layer 2 ordering mechanisms.

Transaction analysis is completed in a separate file.
