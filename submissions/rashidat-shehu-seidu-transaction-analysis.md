This analysis is based on the Ethereum transaction with the hash below: 0x09ddc13b4f48b3f32d750fe86b45a00a5930a4adc57b443ecb7b242ee7069b00e

The transaction is a simple ETH transfer between two normal wallets. It was not a smart contract call. The sender address transferred 0.052439275746648 ETH to the receiver. The transaction succeeded.

The gas price used was 2.891631112 Gwei, which is very low compared to times when the network is busy. The transaction fee was around 0.000060724253352 ETH. The gas used and confirmation count can be seen on Etherscan.

Because this is just a basic ETH transfer, there is no input data and no events. It is not an ERC token transfer and it didn’t interact with any contract. That means nothing complicated happened in the background.

From looking at this transaction, it seems like a normal payment or wallet-to-wallet transfer. The sender paid a very small fee, which suggests that the network was not congested at the time. There are no red flags or unusual activities. Everything looks standard.

The main takeaway from analyzing this transaction is understanding what a normal ETH transfer looks like on a blockchain explorer. It also shows how to check fees, values, sender, receiver, and confirmations, which is important when verifying payments or tracking funds.
